Dean Lai hopes to release the results of the Penghu case to the public in the form of a press conference. Therefore, the proposals discussed at the Wuhu Collaborative Meeting have room for further implementation.</p>

<h4 id="implementing-the-resolution-the-ministry-will-be-indispensable">Implementing the resolution, the ministry will be indispensable</h4>

<p>In the collaborative meeting, both the sponsor and the fishermen’s representatives actually agree on the importance of sustainable fisheries. Therefore, in addition to the follow-up research, investigation and improvement of the Four Islands National Park in the South, many issues have been discussed in terms of strengthening law enforcement to protect local fishery resources.</p>

<p>However, if the hospital wants to open a press conference, it must first confirm that the "policy promised by the press conference will be realized". In fact, there is only a preliminary consensus with the current collaborative conference, "the direction of the ministry will be referenced". The distance of a period of implementation. Therefore, after the dean's assignment, many ministries also began to move.</p>

<p>In terms of meeting resolutions, first of all, illegal fishing in the Four Islands National Park in the South, should the penalty be issued under the National Parks Act, or will it be punished under the Fisheries Law? For public authorities, it is important to discuss the application of the policy to confirm the applicable law, so this is a very important discussion.</p>

<p>This issue involves the competent authorities, and the Marine Department's Marine National Park Management Office and the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of the Interior have proposed different arguments. Finally, <a href="https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2017-11-17-%e6%be%8e%e6%b9%96%e5%8d%97%e6%96%b9%e5%9b%9b%e5%b3%b6%e5%9c%8b%e5%ae%b6%e5%85%ac%e5%9c%92%e8%87%aa%e7%84%b6%e4%ba%ba%e6%96%87%e7%94%9f%e6%85%8b%e6%99%af%e8%a7%80%e5%8d%80%e7%a0%94%e5%95%86%e6%9c%83%e8%ad%b0#s120700">the Ministry of Justice believes</a>, the "Fisheries Law" is a special law in the "National Parks Project", "the fishery activities prohibited by the fishery authorities." Penalties should be imposed on the basis of the Fisheries Law.</p>

<p>In terms of policy implementation, as residents are concerned about the problem of traffic ships, they also asked the Ministry of Communications and Wuhu County to understand the traffic problems. Initially, the local government has already subsidized the transportation vessels, and the initial planning during the off-season is 2 per week. A round-trip boat class will be added to the class during the peak season.</p>

<p>In terms of law enforcement issues, the maritime patrol office has already carried out the forward deployment, planning to enter the seven-year patrol mission, and strengthening the law enforcement energy through the forward-looking plan. It is expected to break the fishing of the mainland fishing vessels that local fishermen and conservationists are worried about. problem. As for future research, the Marine Management Department will continue to implement the entrusted management research case of the four islands in the south. The Fisheries Department will also conduct an ecological survey on the local carp, and look forward to a better understanding of the ecological history of the fish species. Can further find a proper management plan.</p>

<p>The Marine Department will also hire local staff as “environmental maintainers” or train volunteers to increase local employment opportunities and allow local people to participate in conservation and help with conservation resources. Further, fishermen who want to transform into tourism industry will also launch training programs. If fishermen hope to continue fishing under the premise of sustainable fisheries, they will also plan to let fishermen go abroad to visit and learn about the sustainable fisheries of other countries. Planning and development.</p>

<p>In order to let the public see the process of policy formation, PDIS also produced the <a href="http://penghu.pdis.tw/">Policy Resume</a> of this case for journalists and friends. Social public reference.</p>

<h4 id="at-the-press-conference-there-are-still-confrontations-between-the-two-sides">At the press conference, there are still confrontations between the two sides.</h4>

<p>At the press conference, the deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior, Hua Jingqun, explained the relevant actions of the follow-up government in this case. The county magistrate Chen Guangfu also took the video. The way to explain the follow-up actions in Wuhu County and promise that the current restrictions will not change in the short term. Xu Xiande, the head of Wangan Township, pointed out that the government should deal with the problem of cross-border fishing of Chinese fishing boats. It also reiterated that environmental protection should be taken into account in the case of obtaining livelihood security for fishermen. The representatives of the fishermen’s association in Wuhu District reiterated that the government should not compress fisheries too quickly. The proponent Wu Zuxiang explained that his proposal is to hope to protect the fishery resources, so that the fishermen can have more fish to catch in the future, and at the same time, they can also take into account the protection of the environment. I hope that the sea management office can plan carefully in the future to allow the ocean to recuperate and recover. vitality. A reporter said that this time the case is still in the drafting stage, the government is willing to find a positive and negative party to open a press conference. In fact, the issue can be made clearer. This is the first time he has seen a press conference with positive The two sides attended the meeting with the officials. "It is usually the seminar that has this opportunity." Regarding the difference in views between fishermen and sponsors, the reporter believes that it is normal and not too nervous.</p>

<h4 id="information-synchronization-is-still-the-future-challenge-of-collaborative-meetings">Information synchronization is still the future challenge of collaborative meetings</h4>

<p>Is it satisfactory for the results? The proponent admits that he is not very satisfied with this result because the county magistrate specifically expressed his support for the fishermen; but he is very grateful to have such a collaborative meeting that he can understand the fishermen's ideas to a certain extent. In the follow-up of the conference, he hopes to let him know when there is further policy planning in the future. He said with emotion, "The promotion of some issues is not only bloody." In the future, it will take time to communicate with fishermen. He also has the willingness to continue dialogue with fishermen to find a win-win solution.</p>

<p>Participation in the pre-conference meeting, the collaborative meeting did open up the space for dialogue, allowing each other to have a dialogue on the handling of the waters of the four island national parks in the south, and indeed a certain degree of consensus; but at the meeting After that, the ministries will still have some localism, so that the follow-up discussions have gone through a period of talk. This colleague suggested that in the future, it may be possible to plan for the second-level or higher level, moderately enter the meeting process, understand and support the direction of the meeting discussion, and solve the problem of localism.</p>

<p>At the same time, although there is a certain degree of consensus in collaborative meetings, this consensus does not seem to be easily passed to friends who are not involved in collaborative meetings. Through several meetings after the meeting, the colleagues in the relevant departments of the government agencies have been able to understand the conclusions of the collaborative meeting and the various information at the time; but at the same time, the external fishermen’s representatives did not seem to receive the same message, resulting in The fishermen still misunderstand that the government will push the fishing area to the fore, causing repeated protests. Colleagues believe that this may be because fishermen’s representatives must defend the interests of the local people, so it is still necessary to make a tougher statement.</p>

<p>How can the collaborative meeting information be fully circulated in these different roles and fully understood by those who are not present? This is the challenge we need to face in the future.</p>
