      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>September 6th is the third workshop for tax filing software.</p>

<p>Every year in May, almost all people in Taiwan must use software to file tax returns. However, in the design thinking of tax filing software, the user experience has not been considered, and the needs of mac users have been neglected. The sound came out. In May 2016, some netizens felt dissatisfied with the use of tax filing software and went to the Join platform to propose that "the tax filing software is difficult to use." I hope that the government can improve the interface of the tax filing software and make the user experience better.</p>

<p>With the assistance of the Public Digital Innovation Space (PDIS), three tax filing software workshops were launched, and the official staff of the IRS were invited to meet with the first-line people to discuss the interface of the tax filing software. . The first workshop was mainly to take stock of the lack of current software, and the second workshop conducted in-depth mining and analysis of these shortcomings, trying to find blind spots in the system planning behind it. The workshop hopes to design a new interface prototype. By discussing, we can provide some prototypes for manufacturers to further improve the shortcomings of current software.</p>

<p>The proposed UI/UX designer Zhuo Zhiyuan observed that many colleagues in the business system did not dare to let go of planning the UI, but many of the participating people were very happy to have the opportunity to help the government improve the digital service experience. The sleeves are used to start, and the colleagues in the official system are given suggestions for revision. In this process, the public can understand the considerations and limitations of the planning of the public service system, and the public service system can understand the real needs and considerations of the users.</p>

<p>Participating in the public service system of the event believes that although some workload has been added, such a model can avoid the shortcomings of the past government to build a car behind the door, and it can be incorporated into the needs of the people at the time of planning, so that the software produced can be Services can give people a better experience. However, they also admit that although the people think very freely, but in the future, they still have to look at the restrictions of the policy and the resources of the ministry. They may not be in one step and may need to be prioritized. The staff of the financial information center responsible for tax filing software said that in the future, this model will continue to be used to understand the needs of the people. If it is worried that such a model consumes too much resources, it will also adopt a telemetry method, and ask the public to fill in the needs and opinions after use. Improve the software experience.</p>

<p>People who participated in the workshop thought that such a model is very good. I hope that when the government plans the demand, it will be able to incorporate the voice of the people as soon as possible and take a little less.</p>

<p>Of course, this event also has corresponding shortcomings. The colleagues of the public service observed that the members of the three workshops were not fixed. At the time of discussion, it was sometimes necessary to spend some time to supplement the past discussions. However, the public thinks that there is already a pre-conference meeting, and basically has not been affected by too much. The instructor who participated in the activity, Pipe Week, pointed out that sometimes the designer still does not consciously use the term when he speaks, but if he forgets to explain these terms, the public may be confused, it may be a point that needs to be reminded of each other; The pipe week also reminds us that it is necessary to ensure that all those involved in the event know the purpose, the constraints, and the outcome of the expected output. The pipe week thinks that the three events may still be somewhat lengthy. It is suggested that the current ratio can be maintained, the scale can be reduced, and it may be more efficient and resource-saving.</p>

<p>In addition, the public and business colleagues also found that there were relatively few technical people in this activity. They worried that some of the designed results may not be actually made. It is suggested that in planning future activities, besides designing people, Those who incorporate technical implementation will eliminate designs that cannot be implemented as soon as possible. Some designers have also reminded that the event can be designed to be shorter, and it will be implemented immediately after planning, and observe the feeling of using it, and give it back soon. Some people also reminded that in the future, we should pay attention to the equality of the right to speak, and avoid officials or people with greater discourse power to dominate the entire demand planning process. However, most of the participants still gave positive comments on the event and hoped that the experience could be replicated in different fields in the future. The pipe week emphasized that, like the high-speed rail, as long as the government has done a good job of infrastructure, it can help more people save time and increase efficiency. Although the activity seems to take a lot of time and resources, if the future can improve the experience of people using tax filing software and reduce the time spent by people on tax filing software, it is a way to avoid national idling.</p>
